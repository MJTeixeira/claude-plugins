# Issue tracker: GitLab

Inbound requests for this repo live as GitLab issues. Use the [`glab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) CLI for all operations.

This is the **inbound** surface only — the raw bug reports and feature requests `/triage`
works. The flow's own artefacts never live here: specs go to `.factory/spec/`, tasks and
decision tickets to `.factory/backlog/`.

It is also **not the Factory's tracker**. A registered Factory files its
needs-human questions and its daily log wherever its own `config.json` says —
the fleet uses Discord threads — and reads your answers back from there. That is
a separate surface carrying traffic in the opposite direction: the Factory asking
you, not other people asking the project.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `glab issue create --title "..." --description "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line descriptions. Pass `--description -` to open an editor.
- **Read an issue**: `glab issue view <number> --comments`. Use `-F json` for machine-readable output.
- **List issues**: `glab issue list -F json` with appropriate `--label` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `glab issue note <number> --message "..."`. GitLab calls comments "notes".
- **Apply / remove labels**: `glab issue update <number> --label "..."` / `--unlabel "..."`. Multiple labels can be comma-separated or by repeating the flag.
- **Close**: `glab issue close <number>`. `glab issue close` does not accept a closing comment, so post the explanation first with `glab issue note <number> --message "..."`, then close.
- **Merge requests**: GitLab calls PRs "merge requests". Use `glab mr create`, `glab mr view`, `glab mr note`, etc. — the same shape as `gh pr ...` with `mr` in place of `pr` and `note`/`--message` in place of `comment`/`--body`.

Infer the repo from `git remote -v` — `glab` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

## Merge requests as a triage surface

**MRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external merge requests as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, MRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `glab mr` equivalents:

- **Read an MR**: `glab mr view <number> --comments` and `glab mr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **List external MRs for triage**: `glab mr list -F json`, then keep only MRs whose author is not a project member/owner (a contributor's MR, not a maintainer's in-flight work).
- **Comment / label / close**: `glab mr note`, `glab mr update --label`/`--unlabel`, `glab mr close`.

Unlike GitHub, GitLab numbers issues and MRs separately, so `#42` is unambiguous once you know which surface the maintainer means.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitLab issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `glab issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

None here. `/chart` writes its map into `.factory/backlog/index.md` and its decision
tickets into the effort's epic file beside it, on every tracker — the storage is fixed by
the backlog format, so there is nothing per-tracker to configure.
